        <p> As researchers, we used environmental sensors to monitor changes in lake water quality
            data. This was the focus of our research because lakes are a vital economic, recreational
            and environmental resource in the Hudson Valley where we are based. The EXO1 was the specific
            environmental sensor we used in our selected lakes Mohonk and Osiris. The EXO1 can sense parameters
            such as temperature, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, and chlorophyll simultaneously, making it a very
            efficient research tool. Before it could be used in the field it required calibration for each parameter
            in a specific water solution, so that it would read accurate measurements. The R programming language was
            how we took data from the EXO1 and interpreted as well as visualized it. In this language we developed
            graphs
            from EXO1 data, which revealed an anomaly in Mohonk Lake, as oxygen and chlorophyll levels are expected to
            be
            highest at lakes surface but at Mohonk they were highest about 9 meters down. We also used R to
            create graphs of historical data available to us, which showed irrefutable evidence that temperature
            in the Mohonk area has increased over the past 130 years. </p>
