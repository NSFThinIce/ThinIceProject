        <h1>On Thin Ice</h1>
        
        <p>
            Lakes around the world face rapidly warming temperatures coupled with shorter winters.
            These threats facing our lakes have an impact on the surface ice formation and coverage in winter and can impact growth
            of lake algae and their interactions with other aquatic organisms. Increased algal blooms threaten
            water quality, drinking water supply, and recreation, as well as energy flow through food webs.

        <h1>Project Discription</h1>
        <p>
            In this project, researchers will mimic climate-induced changing lake futures by studying U.S.
            lakes from north to south, and ranging from ice covered to ice free in winter months. Their research
            will examine algal growth and interactions on a year-round scale using field observations, experiments
            and high-frequency environmental sensors, and will employ predictive modeling to assess how changes
            in climate will affect lake ecosystem structure and function. Broader Impacts will be achieved through
            the vehicles of community science, training of undergraduate and graduate researchers, and public
            engagement.
            Workforce development initiatives will provide training for water treatment plant operators at drinking
            water
            reservoirs and high school students. By engaging youth and community scientists, these partners/participants
            will be trained to actively serve as stewards of water quality in their respective communities, empowering
            them
            to be knowledgeable and engaged in research related to climate impacts on lake ecosystems.
