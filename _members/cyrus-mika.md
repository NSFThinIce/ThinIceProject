Hello! My name is Cyrus Mika and I am a graduating Senior at SUNY New Paltz majoring in Environmental Studies with a double minor in Geology and Computer Science. I have been active as a researcher in Dr. Richardson's Lab, assisting with field work and data collection from Mohonk Lake. Currently I am working on a project called "Classifying reservoirs into different types: does water body type affect responses to climate?" which will be presented at the Ecological Society of America conference in Baltimore in August 2025.
