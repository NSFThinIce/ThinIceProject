I am an ecosystem ecologist and aquatic biogeochemist who studies the transformation and movement of matter and energy in watersheds. My research investigates how global and regional scale stressors affect lakes and is built around two key questions: How do multi-scaled stressors alter the structure and function of lakes? And what factors mediate lake responses to environmental change?

My research splits into two complementary themes: aquatic biogeochemistry in mountain ecosystems and data-intensive landscape limnology using both predictive and process-based models. We are particularly interested in the ways that hydrology and landscape settings influence heterogeneous patterns in lake chemistry and ecosystem metabolism.
