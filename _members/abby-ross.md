Abby was raised spending time in the mountains and lakes of Maine. She got her BS in Biology at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and worked for the Jefferson Project doing cyanotoxin analysis in Upstate New York before starting graduate school. Currently, she is doing her PhD with Professor Isabella Oleksy in the Mountain Limnology Lab at CU Boulder. Abby is interested in biogeochemical cycling of carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur in alpine lakes, microbial ecology, and cyanotoxin production during algal blooms.
