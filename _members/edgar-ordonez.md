Hello, my name is Edgar Ordonez, and I am currently attending SUNY New Paltz to obtain a degree in Organismal Biology. During the summer of 2025, I was given the opportunity to run a research project, titled "The Effects of Ice Coverage on the Abundacne of Algae" with the help of my lab partner Gabriella Small and our professor, Dr. Richardson. Currently, I am working as a Summer Research Technician in Dr. Richardson's lab, where I calibrate different measuring sensors for our weekly water sampling at Mohonk Lake, while gaining experience in data managemenet laboratory techniques.
