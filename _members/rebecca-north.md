Rebecca is an emerging researcher in aquatic ecology and biogeochemistry, with expertise on nutrient and algal dynamics in water bodies. She left the great white North and joined the School of Natural Resources at the University of Missouri. Her PhD in limnology was obtained at the University of Waterloo in Ontario, Canada where she worked on eutrophication issues in the African and North American Great Lakes. Her postdoctoral fellowship at Trent University, Ontario, Canada facilitated the expansion of her work to include the watershed, where she examined non-point sources of nutrient loading to a large lake. Her work as a Research Associate with the Global Institute for Water Security at the University of Saskatchewan, Saskatchewan, Canada has been focused on light-nutrient interactions in a large reservoir and the importance of winter processes.
