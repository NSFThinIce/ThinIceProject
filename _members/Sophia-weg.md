Hi! I'm Sophia Weg, an environmental biology major at SUNY New Paltz working in Dr. Richardson's aquatic ecology lab. I help with monthly Thin Ice sampling and processing at Mohonk Lake in the Hudson Valley. With Dr. Richardson's assistance, I am working on my own project analyzing water clarity data to find seasonal and annual patterns and make connections with precipitation and phytoplankton abundance.
