I am a freshwater ecologist studying how ponds and lakes function and respond to environmental change. My research program focuses on community and ecosystem ecology, and I am interested in how organisms and ecosystem processes interact. I ask questions about freshwater food webs, community composition, greenhouse gas production, and ecosystem metabolism. My research relies on field studies, small-scale and whole-ecosystem experiments, and collaborations to scale local observations to global patterns.
