Hello! I am a computer science student at SUNY New Paltz and I worked with my lab partner Edgar Ordonez and Dr. Richardson in the Summer of 2025 to produce a Thin Ice adjacent project titled: "The Effects of Ice Coverage on the Abundance of Algae". I am currently working on maintaining this website with my colleagues Chrristopher Jameison and Rodolfo Baez.
