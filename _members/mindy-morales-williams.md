I'm a limnologist specializing in phycology and biogeochemistry. My research interests include phytoplankton community ecology, cyanobacteria bloom dynamics, land-water linkages, and effects of eutrophication on carbon cycling in lake ecosystems. I investigate how fine scale physiological and ecological mechanisms feedback to drive ecosystem and landscape scale processes.
